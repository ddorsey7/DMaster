<h2>The Kitten in the Box</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your a cat in a box, avoiding killer balls.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience I want the player to feel is fun and stress at the same time.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A casual game, like candy crush, with little strategy and more timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player will dodge the bouncing balls and try to survive for 60 seconds. The player has a life of 1000 points. Each ball hit is -20 points. If the cat get hit hundred times then the player dies. The best strategy is too not the balls for they will bounce faster and off each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game mechanic this is prototype evaluating the bouncing physics and player's reaction time.
</li>

The unique aspects of my game that set it apart is it all about dodging and nothing else. It's simplistic and fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
One minute
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Player strategies that will be effective at playing this game would be not knocking any of balls and move slowly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets use where a cat drawing, ball animation, and a desposit photo of a box.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Games that most closely resembles my game are "Bounce and Knock" and  "Group vs. Self."
